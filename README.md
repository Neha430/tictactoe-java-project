# tictactoe-java-project
A console-based Tic Tac Toe game in Java that allows two players (X and O) to play on a 3×3 grid. The program validates moves, checks for winners across rows, columns, and diagonals, and declares a draw if no valid moves remain. This project demonstrates the use of Java basics, loops, arrays, conditionals, and input handling.
